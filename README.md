# Blog Generation Project

## Section 1: Introduction and Dataset Creation

## Overview
This section is the first part of the DL-2 project, aimed at creating a dataset and fine-tuning a model to generate blog content from given summaries. It builds on concepts from DL Part 1 but can be followed independently.

## Key Components
1. **Dataset Creation:** We create a dataset using the Medium Articles dataset from Kaggle, which includes titles, summaries, and full content of articles.
2. **Extractive Summarization:** We use NLTK and Gensim to generate summaries by selecting the most important sentences from the articles.
3. **Implementation:** Code snippets are provided to help generate summaries and save them into a CSV file.

## How to Use
1. Download the Medium Articles dataset from Kaggle.
2. Follow the steps to generate summaries using the provided Python code.
3. Save the summaries and corresponding articles into a CSV file for use in the next section.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NLTK
- Gensim
- Pandas
- Kaggle API key
